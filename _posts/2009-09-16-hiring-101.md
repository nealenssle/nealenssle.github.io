Foraker just posted my new blog article: “[Hiring 101](http://www.foraker.com/blog/hiring-101)“. The key point:

>At Foraker, we recognize that our best chance at success involves getting the right people on our bus. So we’re almost always looking for people who live and breathe the web, who are passionate about getting just a little bit better every single day, who enjoy the challenge of working closely with a team of like-minded individuals, and who are eager to produce exceptional websites and web applications for our clients.

What we look for: Passion + team fit, then general intelligence, then core skills. In that order.
