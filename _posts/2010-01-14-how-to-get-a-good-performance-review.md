How to get an “A+” on your performance review
My advice on how to get an awesome grade at your next performance review is to simply follow Rands’ advice:

@rands, 1/11/2010: “Be productive, be fantastically clever when necessary, speak truth to power, hit your dates, and don’t ship crap.”

By the way, if you’re a programmer or a manager of programmers and you’re not reading everything that Michael Lopp, a.k.a. Rands in Repose has to say, you’re missing out big time.
