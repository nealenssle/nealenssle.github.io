Foraker Labs just posted this (unofficial) YouTube video of the lightning talk I had a chance to give at the Mountain.rb Ruby conference last week in downtown Boulder, Colorado:

How to Become a Better Programmer in 90 Days

In this brief talk I present highlights from three books on my required reading list that (I believe) will help make you a better programmer:

The Passionate Programmer by Chad Fowler
Clean Code by Robert C. Martin
Refactoring by Martin Fowler

Thanks to Derek Olson for taping and editing, and thanks again to Marty Haught for organizing the conference!
