[Foraker Labs](http://www.foraker.com) just posted this (unofficial) YouTube video of the lightning talk I had a chance to give at the Mountain.rb Ruby conference last week in downtown Boulder, Colorado:

[How to Become a Better Programmer in 90 Days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wzk4rJCvICc)

In this brief talk I present highlights from three books on my required reading list that (I believe) will help make you a better programmer:

- [The Passionate Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/Passionate-Programmer-Remarkable-Development-Pragmatic-ebook/dp/B00AYQNR5U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1438556092&sr=8-1&keywords=passionate+programmer+fowler) by Chad Fowler
- [Clean Code](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1438556052&sr=8-1&keywords=clean+code+robert+martin) by Robert C. Martin
- [Refactoring](http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1438556112&sr=8-1&keywords=refactoring+fowler) by Martin Fowler
