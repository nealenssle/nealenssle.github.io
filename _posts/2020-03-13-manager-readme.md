I'll be starting a new job soon (!), and so I just finally got around to writing up a **[manager README](/README)**. A manager README is a document that is intended to help introduce folks I work with to my understanding of my role as a software engineering manager, my leadership style and management philosophy, my general expectations for folks I work with, and other useful information about me (including some quirks). Check it out!
