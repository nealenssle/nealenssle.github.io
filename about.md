This is a blog mostly about managing programmers, engineers, developers, designers, technical and creative types.

My name is **Neal Enssle**. I'm Director of Software Development at [LogRhythm](http://www.logrhythm.com), a Boulder-based company specializing in security intelligence. I manage several teams of software developers and our user experience design team. We're working on building a next-generation user interface for some of best security software in the world. In past lives I've worked at [Rally](http://rally.com), [Foraker Labs](http://www.foraker.com), [Acxiom](http://acxiom.com), and the [University of Chicago](http://uchicago.edu).

In my free time I volunteer as President on the Board of Directors at [Flagstaff Academy](http://flagstaffacademy.org), where my two kids go to school. It's a pretty amazing school, and they're pretty amazing kids. I also coach soccer and generally try to help my wife, Tara, pay attention to all the amazing things the kids are doing.
