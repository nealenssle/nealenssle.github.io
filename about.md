This is a blog mostly about managing programmers, engineers, developers, designers, technical and creative types.

My name is **Neal Enssle**. In my free time I'm Director of Software Development at [LogRhythm](http://www.logrhythm.com), a Boulder-based company specializing in security intelligence. I managed several teams of software developers and our user experience design team. We're working on building a next-generation user interface for some of best security software in the world.

I volunteer as President on the Board of Directors at [Flagstaff Academy](http://flagstaffacademy.org), where my two kids go to school. It's a pretty amazing school, and they're pretty amazing kids. I also coach soccer and generally try to help my wife, Tara, and pay attention to all the awesome things the kids are doing.
