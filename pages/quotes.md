### programming

"Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live." &ndash; _Martin Golding_

"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand." &ndash; _Martin Fowler_

"Remember that your code is for a human first and a computer second. Humans need good names. Take note of when you have spent ages trying to do something that would have been easier if a couple of methods had been better named. Good naming is a skill that requires practice; improving this skill is the key to being a truly skillful programmer." &ndash; _Martin Fowler_

"Whenever I have to think to understand what the code is doing, I ask myself if I can refactor the code to make that understanding more immediately apparent." &ndash; _Martin Fowler_

"Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. ...[Therefore,] making it easy to read makes it easier to write." &ndash; _Robert C. Martin_

"Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute." &ndash; _Harold Ableson_

"Making code readable is not an optional part of the development process, and favoring write-time convenience over read-time convenience is a false economy." &ndash; _Steve McConnell_

"Programming is the art of doing one thing at a time" &ndash; _Michael Feathers_

"Occam's Razor: The explanation requiring the fewest assumptions is most likely to be correct." &ndash; _William of Occam_

"Premature optimization is the root of all evil in programming." &ndash; _C. A. R. Hoare_

"If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t matter how fast it doesn’t work." &ndash; _Mich Ravera_

"If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in." &ndash; _Edsger Dijkstra_

"A brute force solution that works is better than an elegant solution that doesn't work." &ndash; _Steve McConnell_

"We build our computer (systems) the way we build our cities: over time, without a plan, on top of ruins." &ndash; _Ellen Ullman_

"Human beings are not accustomed to being perfect, and few areas of human activity demand it. Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program." &ndash; _Frederick Brooks_

"Encapsulate the concept that varies." &ndash; _Erich Gamma_

"No one in the brief history of computing has ever written a piece of perfect software. It's unlikely that you'll be the first." &ndash; _Andy Hunt_

"Some of the best programming is done on paper, really. Putting it into the computer is just a minor detail." &ndash; _Max Kanat-Alexander_

"Parkinson's Law: Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion." &ndash; _Cyril Northcote Parkinson_

"Brooks' Law: Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later." &ndash; _Frederick Brooks_

"What one programmer can do in a month, two programmers can do in two." &ndash; _Frederick Brooks_

"Much of the essence of building a program is in fact the debugging of the specification." &ndash; _Frederick Brooks_

"When people say that pair programming reduces productivity, I answer that would be true if the most time consuming part of programming was typing." &ndash; _Martin Fowler_

"You can't control what you can't measure." &ndash; _Tom DeMarco_

"Excuses sound like they feel." &ndash; _Michael Lopp_

"The skillsets that let people thrive in dysfunctional situations may not translate to healthy situations. And vice versa." &ndash; _John Cutler_

"Poor management can increase software costs more rapidly than any other factor." &ndash; _Barry Boehm_

"Conway's Law: Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure." &ndash; _Mel Conway_

"Computer Science is the only discipline in which we view adding a new wing to a building as being maintenance." &ndash; _Jim Hornig_

"The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer is doing until it's too late." &ndash; _Seymour Cray_

"When it comes to processes, adherence to the process frequently becomes the objective, as opposed to achieving the objective that the process was put in place to achieve." &ndash; _David Marquet_

"In all large corporations, there is a pervasive fear that someone, somewhere is having fun with a computer on company time." &ndash; _John Dvorak_

"Documentation is like sex; when it's good, it's very, very good, and when it's bad, it's better than nothing." &ndash; _Dick Brandon_

"Learning is limited by an organization's ability to keep its people." &ndash; _Tom DeMarco_

"An organisation that treats its programmers as morons will soon have programmers that are willing and able to act like morons only." &ndash; _Bjarne Stroustrup_

"Treating your rocket scientist employees as if they were still in kindergarten is not an isolated phenomenon. Almost every company has some kind of incentive program that is insulting and demeaning." &ndash; _Joel Spolsky_

"If you think your management doesn't know what it's doing or that your organization turns out low-quality software crap that embarrasses you, then leave." &ndash; _Ed Yourdon_

"The job of the average manager requires a shift in focus every few minutes. The job of the average software developer requires that the developer not shift focus more often than every few hours." &ndash; _Steve McConnell_

"All good work is done in defiance of management." &ndash; _Bob Woodward_

"There are always two or three sides to every story." &ndash; _Neal Enssle_

"Design adds value faster than it adds cost." &ndash; _Joel Spolsky_

"Design without code is just a daydream. Code without design is a nightmare." &ndash; _Assaad Chalhoub_

"Luck is the residue of design." &ndash; _Branch Rickey_

"Innovation is saying NO to 1,000 things. People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on.... It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully." &ndash; _Steve Jobs_

"Innovation has nothing to do with how many R&D dollars you have. When Apple came up with the Mac, IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R&D. It's not about money. It's about the people you have, how you're led, and how much you get it." &ndash; _Steve Jobs_

"Without requirements or design, programming is the art of adding bugs to an empty text file." &ndash; _Louis Srygley_
