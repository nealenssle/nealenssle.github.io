My name is **Neal Enssle**. And this is a blog mostly about managing programmers, engineers, developers, designers, technical and creative types.

I'm currently Senior Director of Engineering at [Recurly](http://www.recurly.com), a fast-growing Boulder-based fintech company specializing in providing enterprise-class recurring billing, revenue optimization, and subscription management services for thousands of businesses worldwide. I manage several teams of full-stack software developers (both onsite and remote) including our payments and developer experience teams. 

In past lives I've worked in technical and/or management roles at [LogRhythm](http://www.logrhythm.com), [Rally](http://rally.com), [Foraker Labs](http://www.foraker.com), and [Acxiom](http://acxiom.com), and as a history-professor-in-training at the [University of Chicago](http://uchicago.edu).

I've recently revived a fun side project: <a href="http://codequotes.com">code<strong>quotes</strong>.com</a> &mdash; a website dedicated to recording quotations from and about programmers and designers &mdash; is back up and running and I'm migrating content.

Perhaps most importantly, I'm the father of two pretty amazing youngsters: Anna and Noah. In my free time I enjoy long walks in the woods (hiking, camping), spending time with family, and I occasionally volunteer on the Board of Directors at [Flagstaff Academy](http://flagstaffacademy.org), where the kids attend school. I also generally try to help my amazing wife, Tara, shine as a special-education teacher in the St. Vrain Valley School District. The four of us, and Oliver the cat, live in Longmont, Colorado.
