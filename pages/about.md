My name is **Neal Enssle**. And this is a blog filled with my thoughts and ramblings -- mostly about managing programmers, engineers, developers, designers, and creative types. I also have a page where I have collected some of my favorite [quotations](/quotes) about programming, leadership, productivity, design, and quality.

For over 15 years, I have been helping build and lead high-performing software engineering teams that deliver high-quality software in a healthy and balanced way. I have experience leading both day-to-day and strategic software development operations in product, services, and consulting organizations. I have experience managing multiple engineering (front-end, back-end, full-stack) and user experience (UX) design teams in multiple locations (remote and offshore) simultaneously. My industry experience includes: fintech (payments), e-commerce, security, data, healthcare, marketing, education.

I have more than 20 years of professional experience in software engineering overall, and have been a passionate programmer in multiple languages including Ruby, JavaScript, ColdFusion, Java, and various flavors of SQL. My technical interests include “clean coding” techniques, refactoring patterns, and evolutionary architecture. While I continue to enjoy coding in my free time, I feel I am most effective in leadership roles.

I am results-driven and customer-focused. I believe that active listening and open communication can solve most problems. I believe that trust and feedback create positive results. I believe that mistakes provide opportunities for improvement and growth. I try to take a proactive, hands-on, and entrepreneurial approach to building collaboration across teams and organizations. My job is to be a catalyst: get the right folks together in a room; create a safe space for dialogue and innovation; foster consensus on goals; and help iterate toward attainable solutions. 

For more about my management style and leadership philosophy, please see my **[manager README](/README)**.

I'm currently Senior Director of Engineering at [Recurly](http://www.recurly.com), a fast-growing Boulder-based financial technology (fintech) company specializing in providing enterprise-class recurring billing, revenue optimization, and subscription management services for thousands of businesses worldwide. I lead several teams of full-stack software developers (both onsite and remote) including our payments, 3rd-party integrations, and developer experience teams. 

In past lives I've worked in technical leadership roles at LogRhythm, Rally Software, Foraker Labs, and Acxiom, with experience delivering high-quality software in diverse industries such as healthcare, education, marketing, transportation, security, e-commerce, and finance. A long time ago I was a history professor in training at the University of Chicago. For more career info, check out [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nealenssle).

Perhaps most importantly, I'm happily married and the proud father of two pretty amazing youngsters. In my free time I enjoy long walks in the woods, reading, spending time with friends and family, and the occasional romp through [Skyrim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_V:_Skyrim). I volunteer on the Board of Directors at [Flagstaff Academy](http://flagstaffacademy.org), where the kids attend school. I also generally try to help my amazing wife shine as a special-education teacher in the St. Vrain Valley School District. The four of us, along with Oliver the cat, live in sunny Longmont, Colorado.
