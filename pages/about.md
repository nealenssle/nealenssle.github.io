My name is **Neal Enssle**. And this is a blog filled with my ramblings -- mostly about managing programmers, engineers, developers, designers, and creative types.

I'm currently Senior Director of Engineering at [Recurly](http://www.recurly.com), a fast-growing Boulder-based financial technology (fintech) company specializing in providing enterprise-class recurring billing, revenue optimization, and subscription management services for thousands of businesses worldwide. I lead several teams of full-stack software developers (both onsite and remote) including our payments, 3rd-party integrations, and developer experience teams. 

In past lives I've worked in technical leadership roles at LogRhythm, Rally Software, Foraker Labs, and Acxiom, with experience delivering high-quality software in diverse industries such as healthcare, education, marketing, transportation, security, e-commerce, and finance. A long time ago I was a history professor in training at the University of Chicago. For more career info, check out [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nealenssle).

Perhaps most importantly, I'm happily married and the proud father of two pretty amazing youngsters. In my free time I enjoy long walks in the woods, reading, spending time with friends and family, and the occasional romp through [Skyrim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_V:_Skyrim). I volunteer on the Board of Directors at [Flagstaff Academy](http://flagstaffacademy.org), where the kids attend school. I also generally try to help my amazing wife shine as a special-education teacher in the St. Vrain Valley School District. The four of us, along with Oliver the cat, live in sunny Longmont, Colorado.
