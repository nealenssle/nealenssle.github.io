My name is **Neal Enssle**. And this is a blog mostly about managing programmers, engineers, developers, designers, technical and creative types.

I'm currently Director of Software Development at [LogRhythm](http://www.logrhythm.com), a fast-growing Boulder-based company specializing in security intelligence (we stop bad guys from doing bad things). I manage several teams of software developers and our user experience design team. We're working on building a next-generation user interface for some of best security software in the world.

In past lives I've worked in technical and/or management roles at [Rally](http://rally.com), [Foraker Labs](http://www.foraker.com), and [Acxiom](http://acxiom.com), and as a history-professor-in-training at the [University of Chicago](http://uchicago.edu). For more career info, check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nealenssle) page.

I've recently revived a fun side project: [codequotes.com](http://codequotes.com) &mdash; a website dedicated to recording quotations from and about programmers and designers &mdash; is back up and running and I'm migrating content.

Perhaps most importantly, I'm the father of two pretty amazing youngsters: Anna and Noah. In my free time I volunteer on the Board of Directors at [Flagstaff Academy](http://flagstaffacademy.org), where the kids attend school. I also generally try to help my amazing wife, Tara, pay attention to all the amazing things the amazing kids are doing. The four of us and Oliver the cat live in Longmont, Colorado.
